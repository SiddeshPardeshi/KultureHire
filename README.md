## Problem Statement:
Gen-Z faces challenges in securing roles that align with their career aspirations, often feeling unheard by employers. At the same time, employers struggle to attract, retain, and effectively engage Gen-Z talent, leading to a gap between expectations and workplace realities.

## Data Collection for the Project:
To collect meaningful data for this project, key variables must cover demographics (age, gender, location, education, employment status), career aspirations (preferred industry, job role, work model, salary expectations, relocation willingness), workplace expectations (job selection factors, concerns, preferred benefits, hiring challenges), and employer perception (Gen-Z’s views on how well employers understand and engage with them).

Since Google Forms is efficient for large-scale data collection, it is the best choice, offering easy distribution, anonymous responses, and seamless analysis. The survey should include user-friendly, clear, and engaging questions with multiple-choice, Likert scale, and open-ended formats. Testing the form before full deployment ensures clarity and effectiveness.

## Data Cleaning and Standardization:
For data cleaning and standardization, I used Excel to ensure accuracy and consistency. This involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting inconsistent formats (e.g., standardizing text inputs, salary ranges, and job titles). I also applied data validation to maintain uniform responses and used filters and formulas to identify and correct errors. This step ensured that the dataset was clean, structured, and ready for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis:
For Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), MySQL Workbench was used to extract key insights. SQL queries were applied to summarize, filter, and group data, enabling the identification of trends, patterns, and anomalies. Aggregations such as average salary expectations, industry preferences, and job selection factors provided deeper insights into Gen-Z career aspirations. Additionally, comparisons across demographics helped highlight variations in expectations. This structured approach ensured a data-driven understanding of the gaps between Gen-Z and employer expectations.

## Executive Dashboard & Functional Dashboard:

For the Executive Dashboard, Pivot Tables were used in Excel to create interactive summaries and visualizations. Key metrics such as industry preferences, salary expectations, work model choices, and job selection factors were analyzed. Charts and graphs were incorporated to highlight trends, comparisons, and insights from the data. This dashboard provided a clear and concise overview, enabling stakeholders to quickly understand Gen-Z’s career aspirations and the gaps between their expectations and employer perceptions.
