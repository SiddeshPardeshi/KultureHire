## Problem Statement:
Gen-Z faces challenges in securing roles that align with their career aspirations, often feeling unheard by employers. At the same time, employers struggle to attract, retain, and effectively engage Gen-Z talent, leading to a gap between expectations and workplace realities.

## Data Collection for the Project:
To collect meaningful data for this project, key variables must cover demographics (age, gender, location, education, employment status), career aspirations (preferred industry, job role, work model, salary expectations, relocation willingness), workplace expectations (job selection factors, concerns, preferred benefits, hiring challenges), and employer perception (Gen-Zâ€™s views on how well employers understand and engage with them).

Since Google Forms is efficient for large-scale data collection, it is the best choice, offering easy distribution, anonymous responses, and seamless analysis. The survey should include user-friendly, clear, and engaging questions with multiple-choice, Likert scale, and open-ended formats. Testing the form before full deployment ensures clarity and effectiveness.
